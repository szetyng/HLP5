# HLP5
Team 5 for HLP 2018

Part 1: Modularity
Each person is responsible for one module and its associated Test module.

ToDO:
1. Parse each assembly line  -> list or array of parsed lines

2. List/array of parsed lines undergoes a series of transformations in which information (address in memory of each line, values of all symbols etc) is added -> some structure
(Errors processed in monadic style)

3. Structure represents a program capable of execution. Each instruction can be individually executed by code written at instruction module level 
(If not an error)
