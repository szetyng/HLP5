#### Purpose
This project supports of a subset of ARM UAL instructions with documentation for specific modules in the `\VisualWork\Documentation` folder.

## Implemented modules:
- Shift
- SingleR
- MultiR

The listed modules have been implemented and tested to simulate the Data processing and Memory instructions. This project uses the [VisUAL](https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/index.html) program and a VisualInterface framework for testing. 

## Testing
Individual module testing uses a common VisualInterface and Expecto framework, which makes it easy to understand, refactor develop tests for existing and new modules. 
Top level testing aims to ...

## Top Level functionality
Explain how the code integrates the existing modules, how it does multi-pass to read a program.

## Usage
Example scripts to run program.

## Future integration of modules
Simple depdencencies between modules, easy to create and integrate new modules. 
Explain briefly how to implement and integrate a new module in terms of types and functions required. and how to edit the CommonTop file to do so.
